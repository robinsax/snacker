current:		
* rethink cautious methodology 
	* to select cell without opponents for late game
	* to detect being chased and deploy counter-measures
	* don't go near walls
* carefully space optimize first
* choke map is general heuristic for future danger attention mechanism

misc:
* going into a cell inclosed by self can predicably = certain death
* attack by minimizing choke map values at opponent head
* food in 1-wide cells should be ignored?
* starvation emergency handling

strats:
* prefer destinations with maximal choke-map values as a general heuristic against sticky situations
