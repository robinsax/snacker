* going into a cell inclosed by self can predicably = certain death
* consider it dangerous to move toward another snake's head (that's where unpredicability happens)
* prefer destinations with maximal choke-map values as a general heuristic against sticky situations
* attack by minimizing choke map values at opponent head
* space optimization improvements
* prefer cells without opponents heads in them
* something about own tail not contributing to cell size
* cells with tail segment walls should be prefered
