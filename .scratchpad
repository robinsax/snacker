current:		
* don't go near walls
* carefully space optimize first
* choke map is general heuristic for future danger attention mechanism

misc:
* going into a cell inclosed by self can predicably = certain death
* attack by minimizing choke map values at opponent head
* space optimization improvements
* food in 1-wide cells should be ignored?
* !!! going for food greedily is naive
* starvation emergency handling
* consider it dangerous to move toward another snake's head (that's where unpredicability happens)

strats:
* prefer destinations with maximal choke-map values as a general heuristic against sticky situations
