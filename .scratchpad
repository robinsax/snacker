misc:
* don't go near walls
* going into a cell inclosed by self can predicably = certain death
* consider it dangerous to move toward another snake's head (that's where unpredicability happens)
* prefer destinations with maximal choke-map values as a general heuristic against sticky situations
* attack by minimizing choke map values at opponent head
* space optimization improvements
* prefer cells without opponents heads in them
* something about own tail not contributing to cell size
* cells with tail segment walls should be prefered
* food in 1-wide cells should be ignored?
* !!! going for food greedily is naive
* cell space optimization shouldn't be dangerous if it doesn't have to
* squiggles can be non-optimal in weirdly shaped spaces
* starvation emergency handling
* moving into a cell while favoring tails can lead to starvation
